# Raspberry Pi Zero Enviro pHAT IoT

This repository contains example code to be used in a classroom based exploration of IoT devices, centered around the Raspberry Pi Zero W with a Pimoroni Enviro pHAT.

Every device comes with Raspbian Stretch Lite installed, as well as CouchDB and [the Pimoroni examples](https://github.com/pimoroni/enviro-phat) for the Enviro pHAT.

The purpose of the files in this repository is to:
1. Input sensor data into the CouchDB database
2. Provide a web interface to the sensor data
3. Basic data analysis of the sensor inputs
